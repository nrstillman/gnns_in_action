### GNNs in Action - Chapter 2 - Graph Data Models and Data Pipelining
NOTE: CODE IS BEING REVISED; REVISION TARGET JUNE 20 (JUNE 5)

Welcome to Chapter 2 of _"GNNs in Action"_! In this chapter, we explore the intricacies of graph data models and delve deep into the processes involved in data pipelining. This folder contains all the necessary files and resources that will aid your understanding and enable hands-on practice.

### üìÑ Files Included

#### 1. [GNNsInAction_Chapter_2.ipynb](./GNNsInAction_Chapter_2.ipynb)
This Jupyter notebook contains updated code that corresponds to Chapter 2. It includes detailed explanations, comments, and code cells to help you grasp the concepts of graph data models and data pipelining effectively.

#### 2. [node_attributes_hashed.csv](./node_attributes_hashed.csv)
A CSV file that contains hashed node attributes, offering real-world data for hands-on practice in managing and manipulating graph data.

#### 3. [relationships_hashed.json](./relationships_hashed.json)
A JSON file with hashed relationships data, complementing the node attributes and offering a comprehensive dataset for practical learning.
